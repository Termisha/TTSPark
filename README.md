Trinidad and Tobago Smart Parking System (TTSPark)

Demo: https://youtu.be/z0kFIDzB2s4 

<b>Project Background</b><br />
<p>The proposed solution is to develop a mobile application for a Smart Parking System. <br />
There are two known implementations of SPS in Trinidad: the Piarco International Airport and PriceSmart, La Romain. Since SPS have been widely implemented, the focus of this solution is to augment a SPS by building a mobile application that will provide live updates to the user on the status of parks within the system. We will assume that SPS are implemented for carparks in Trinidad, like the Parkade. QR scanners, placed at the entry and exit of all parking lots and sensors placed at parking bays, will indicate whether a parking spot is available or occupied. Real time information from sensors wolid be uploaded to the online database every 2 to 3 seconds. This information will be analysed and used to present information over the mobile application in real time to the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago.
<br /><br />
Drivers would be able to interact with the system to:
<ol>
  <li>Search for and reserve an available parking spot</li>
  <li>Receive directions (best route) to reserved parking spot</li>
  <li>Receive totals and make payment for parking spot</li>
  <li>Receive updates on status of parking spots</li>
  <li>Receive updates on surrounding traffic or issues that may cause traffic</li>
  <li>Create reports on parking spot (e.g. report an issue with the spot)</li>
</ol>
Administrators wolid be able to interact with the system to:
<ol>
  <li>View and update status and additional information of parking spots and lots</li>
  <li>Detect improper parking</li>
  <li>Enter information received from the Government, Municipal Corporations and/or Police/ Fire Service about parking spots</li>
</ol>
